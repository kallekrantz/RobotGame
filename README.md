##How to contribute
This project uses git, and is currently hosted on Github at [https://github.com/kallekrantz/RobotGame](https://github.com/kallekrantz/RobotGame)  
Although a goal would be to have a perfect git history, multiple of the projects participants are not familiar with the complications of git. Something that can/will result in horrible git commits and amends.
#### How to

If you do not have git setup properly, please follow the following guides  
[https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git  ](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git  )  
[https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys  ](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)



To fetch the repository to start developing  
```git clone git@github.com:kallekrantz/RobotGame.git```  

In order to start your own branch for development.  
```git checkout -b <feature to work on>```

Or fork through Githubs interface.
### Code Reviews
Either ask to become a contributer, or send of a Pull Request. This is best done through the Github interface via your own branch/fork.
Code reviews should be applied as Pull Requests through Github. This means that all features should be it's own branch which then will be merged into Master.  
Master should at all time be runnable, which means that all code reviews should be run before being merged into master.
#### How to
The general workflow for code reviewing is the following.

    git pull origin master
    git checkout <branch to work on>
    <--All work is done-->
    git commit -m "<Commit message>"
    git merge master

After all that is done, apply for the Pull Request through Githubs interface, tag relevant people you want to review.

When the request has been granted, either you or the reviewer should be able to automatically merge the request through Githubs interface, if not, follow the following workflow.

    git pull --all
    git checkout master
    git merge <branch to to merge>
    <-- Fix the merge conflict -->
    git commit -m "fixed merge conflict"
    git push origin master
##Special considerations
Even if something breakes, take a deep breath and contact one of the maintainers, or try to Google for the error and try to fix it on your own if it's manageable.
#Tests
On the backend, tests are currently managed through Junit and Maven.  
However, the frontend is currently undecided. This will be updated when it is relevant.  
##Add your own test
### Frontend
#### No testing framework available
### Backend
Currently Junit.   
Add tests in the src/test/java/com/ folder, either as it's own TestSuite (more specifically there should be a testsuite corresponding to one class), or simply as a method in a testsuite following the pattern of test* where start is the name of the test.  
There will be examples below on how to add tests. in the future.
